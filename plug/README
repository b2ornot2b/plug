This software was created as a Linux replacement for Fender FUSE software for
Fender Mustang guitar amplifier.

Although I am using it myself, I CAN NOT GIVE ANY WARRANTY that it will work or
even that it won't destroy you amplifier in some way. YOUR USING IT AT YOUR OWN
RISK.

1. Compilation

To build program requires Qt4 and libusb-1.0. To build the code you need to
run the following commands in the source directory:
~ $ qmake plug.pro
~ $ make

If both commands finished without errors compilation is finished. Executables
name is "plug" so to run the program just type:
~ $ ./plug

==========
If you are a Mac user and want to build a project for Xcode type:
~ $ qmake -spec macx-xcode plug.pro
==========


2. Usage

  After you successfully compile the code and run the program click
"Connection"-->"Connect" (Ctrl+C) to connect software to the amplifier. Message
"Connected" should appear on the status bar at the bottom of the window. After
that buttons will become active.

==========
NOTE for Ubuntu users:
For some reason Ubuntu allows only root to access USB devices of unknown type.
To change this and allow users in "plugdev" group to also have access to Mustang
amp create file /etc/udev/rules.d/50-mustang.rules containing line:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", SYSFS{idVendor}=="1ed8",
SYSFS{idProduct}=="0004", GROUP="plugdev"

Now either restart computer or unplug amp and restart udev subsystem with the
following command:
~ $ sudo service udev restart
==========

Button titled "Amplifier" allows you to choose amplifier model and it's
settings. In the amplifier window there is also a button named "Advanced" which
hides all the advanced settings of an amplifier.

Effect buttons represents an effect slots. If you want to add an effect:
- select the slot
- select the effect
- set effect options
- press "Set" button to send effect to an amplifier
To add an effect after the amplifier just enable the check box at the bottom in
the effect window.

To save settings in one of amplifiers memory banks click "File"-->"Save on
amplifier". In the newly opened window choose name for your preset  and memory
bank and click save.

To load presets from the amplifier choose "File"-->"Load from amplifier" and in
the window that will appear choose slot to load.

PLUG support also the possibility to save effect presets to MOD and DLY/REV
knobs. To do so set effect you wish to save on one of the effects slot and
choose "Save effects" from "File" menu.
You must set Modulation effects on the "Effect 2" slot, and Delay and Reverb
effects on "Effect 3" and "Effect 4" slots. Otherwise they will not be saved.
